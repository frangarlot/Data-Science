# Data-Science

Projects and practice exercises I have been doing with Python to level up my Data Science skills. Some of them are from different online courses I have taken, like the [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).
